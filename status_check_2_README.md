We are making a functional drone. We have ordered all of the parts, and we are almost done cadding all of the parts that we need. we will be using the blink 
app to controll it, and there will be two joysticks and two buttons. One button is for taking off, which will turn all four motors on and make them hover at
5 feet above the ground. The other one will make the drone land. The joystick on the left controlls throtle and yaw, and the joystick on the right controlls
pitch.
